# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) rules engine that processes license renewal requests using Drools business rules. The system will accept JSON input containing person identification and renewal details, evaluate them against configurable business rules, and provide decisions. The application will be built using Java, Spring Boot, and Drools, with JShell integration for interactive rule testing and modification. The system will expose both REST endpoints for programmatic access and a web-based JShell interface for real-time rule development and testing. Additionally, the system will provide Language Server Protocol (LSP) capabilities for IDE integration, enabling dynamic rule compilation and validation directly from code editors like VS Code.

- **DMV_Rules_Engine**: The main application system that processes license renewal requests using business rules
- **Drools**: A business rule management system that executes rules against fact objects
- **JShell**: Java's interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment for executing Java code snippets
- **LSP**: Language Server Protocol - a protocol for providing language features like syntax highlighting and error detection in code editors
- **REPL**: Read-Eval-Print Loop - an interactive programming environment for dynamic code execution
